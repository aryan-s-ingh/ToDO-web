# ToDO-web
Created a minimalist To-Do web project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Utilized HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Implemented features like adding tasks, marking them complete, and deleting them. Ensured responsiveness for various screen sizes for a seamless user experience.
